  <h1>Support my Legal Case Against the Troubled Teen Industry</h1>
  <p> On November 1, 2024, I was hired as a Social Studies Teacher at a residential treatment center in Utah. After internal complaints, I reported concerns to the state regulator on September 29, 2025. I was terminated on October 15, 2025. I am raising funds for legal counsel and related costs in my employment dispute.</p>
    This fundraiser does not allege conclusions of fact beyond my filings. Funds will be used for attorney fees, filings, records, and mediation. If funds remain after the matter concludes, they will be reserved for post-judgment costs as stated in the policy below. Gifts are not tax-deductible. Updates and redacted invoices will be posted on a regular schedule. </p>
