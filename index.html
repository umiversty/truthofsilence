  <h1>Promote Accountability and Transparency in the Troubled Teen Industry</h1>

    <summary>Why This Matters</summary>
    <p>
      Residential treatment centers play a major role in caring for vulnerable youth,
      yet the people working inside these programs often face conditions that mirror
      the challenges their students experience. When teachers and staff report unsafe
      or unethical practices, they deserve protection—not retaliation.
    </p>
    <p>
      This case highlights the need for transparency and accountability within the
      troubled teen industry (TTI) and the broader system of youth residential care.
      Ensuring fair treatment of educators and frontline staff helps protect the welfare
      of the students they serve.
    </p>
    <div class="accordion" style="max-width:900px; margin:0 auto; text-align:left;">
    <div class="accordion">
        <ul>
            <li>Affirm the right of staff to raise ethical and safety concerns without fear of retaliation.</li>
            <li>Strengthen public oversight of youth treatment facilities.</li>
            <li>Encourage responsible, transparent leadership in programs that serve children.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Every contribution supports legal costs to pursue accountability and promote lasting
            reform in youth residential care.
